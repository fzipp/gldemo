This example program uses GLFW 3 to manage the context and is based on the
OpenGL 3.2 core profile, since this is the latest OpenGL version supported
by OS X.

It demonstrates how to
- set up a context
- load vertex and fragment shaders
- create a VAO and VBO
- init and load PMV matrices
- draw a quad
